# Explore US Bikeshare Data

## Project Overview
This project analyzes US bikeshare data to uncover patterns in ridership. Using Python, we compute descriptive statistics and create an interactive terminal experience to explore the data.

## Data Sources
The dataset is provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for major US cities:  
- Chicago  
- New York City  
- Washington, DC  

## Features
- Load and clean bikeshare data  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Compute key statistics such as trip duration, user demographics, and peak usage times  
- Build an interactive terminal-based tool  

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure the datasets are in the same directory as the script.
3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn wordcloud
```
## Criteria:
- README.md file is filled out in an appropriate way using the headers provided or another reasonable outline of the bikeshare project.


- The student bikeshare file from an earlier project has been added to the repository. You can see that there are differences between the file in the master and refactor branches than the documentation branch.

- Multiple commits were made in different branches.

- Files should have changes and those changes should be committed as described in the tasks. The messages for each should be descriptive of the changes made.
